# Passma
Currently, there are often news about massive hacks to online services. These hacks usually attack services whose databases have a very simple or virtually null security. In the end, as always, the most affected is the user who uses these services. This development tries to help people to manage their personal data in an efficient, automated and secure way, in particular to manage the passwords used to access the services.

This development has an Android frontend service, called Passma, a system capable of generating and managing an unlimited set of passwords with a high degree of security, and a Java backend service called Passma Service that handles data synchronization of Passma.
